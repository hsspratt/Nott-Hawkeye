Description
===========

The IEEEconf class implements the formatting dictated by the IEEE
Computer Society Press for conference proceedings
(ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/proceedings/instruct8.5x11.pdf).
IEEEconf.cls replaces latex8.sty and is compatible with any BibTeX
style, not just latex8.bst.  The goal was to produce a more faithful
implementation of the formatting rules and to do so with cleaner LaTeX
code than that provided by the latex8.* files.


Installation
============

Execute "latex IEEEconf.ins" to create IEEEconf.cls.  Install
IEEEconf.cls at an appropriate place in your directory tree (e.g., in
/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/IEEEconf/ or
C:\localtexmf\tex\latex\IEEEconf\) and update the filename database,
if necessary.  See the UK TeX FAQ (http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq) for more
information on installing classes.

IEEEconf comes with prebuilt PDF documentation formatted for
U.S. Letter paper.  If you want to build the documentation from
scratch, the procedure is as follows:

    latex IEEEconf.dtx
    makeindex -s gind.ist IEEEconf
    makeindex -s gglo.ist IEEEconf.glo -o IEEEconf.gls
    latex IEEEconf.dtx
