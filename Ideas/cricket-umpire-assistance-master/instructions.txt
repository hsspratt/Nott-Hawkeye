Run object_detector/ballTracking.py with arg -v --video -a 0/1 (0 for spin, 1 for fast)

Output in coordinates.txt in the form:
x,y,radius,frame_no,is_bouncing_point, linear_reg_radius, quad_reg_y

Run on VID_20160411_171619.mp4 else change SKIP and DURATION variables accordingly.

Finally run object_detector/3d.py which uses the coordinates generated by ballTracking.py to visualize the trajectory.
